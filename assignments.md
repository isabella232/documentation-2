Assignment Bank
=====
There are assignments in a variety of langauges that are preconfigured to work with OK. They come bundled with OK tests. To enable submission, changing a few characters is all you need.

## License

You are free to use these resources for a _noncommercial_ purpose. If you teach at an accredited higher ed school or K12 instutition - you may use these assignments in your course.

# Enabling Submission

> ```
 { "name": "Project 1: Hog",
  "endpoint": "cal/cs61a/sp17/hog",
  ... }
```

Each assignment contains a file ending with `.ok` - the only thing that you need to change to enable submission the "endpoint" inside of the file. You can change it to your assignment endpoint on the OK Server and that's all it'll take to enable submission. For more details, view the ok server demo video.

## Using Standalone

To use these assignments as a standalone assignment, you do _not_ need to change the endpoint.


# CS1 Assignments

## CS61A
CS61A at UC Berkeley is the introductory course for CS majors. It has been recognized as one the five best computer science in the US.

It focuses on abstraction, recursion, and problem solving. The assignments are rigorous and use a variety of languages.
